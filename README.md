# Clicker_World

Gather villagers, expand your housing, harvest resources, and eventually explore the world in this incremental-lite game.

Features to be implemented:
--NPC Interactions
--NPC Model Variation
--Camera movement
--Wall building
--Stone Housing building
--Various Blacksmith upgrades
--Post-soldider gathering
--Sacrifice/Demolish feature

Notes:
--Number of resources has been left on debug, so players start with a lot of resources to speed up testing
--Proper growth/balancing of resource-gatherering needs tweaking
